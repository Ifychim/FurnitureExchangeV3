Accomplished

-> Set up front end as well as redux for global state management.
-> Link Redux to our react components
-> Display errors from our backend in our React Forms
-> Protected Routes (pages that only certain suers can access based on their authentications)
-> Keep a user logged when they refresh or leave the page (I.E until they either logout or the jwt expires)


-> Implemented update functionality 
-> Implemented delete functionality 
-> Implemented like functionality 
-> Bug with each card's photo.
-> Deployed Application Backend (Heroku to deploy the backend. There are Errors Here.)


-> add constants for action type (good practice for redux)
-> Implemented mobile responsiveness
-> Implemented functionality to clear a form.
-> Netlify to deploy front end (SUCCESSFUL)

-> Added Docker (with help need to review this process)


For next week
-> Start on login/signup (PRIORITY)
-> Recreated Navbar. Made seperate component so we can make it more complex and not clutter app.js.


-> Fix continous deployment for client side code.
-> Fix backend deployment.
-> Reform edit functionality (more user friendly)

Tasks completed this week (11/4/2021)
-> Finshed implementing google-o-auth (sign in sign out)

-> Finished implementing login with form data (json web token, requires both backend and front-end work.)
-> Fixed bug with signing out, now the token is deleted from local storage properly on sign-out
-> Password Hashing in backend works with use of bcrypt library

stopped 2:07:54

location info (geo-tag) (Can add geo tag to each post and filter by nearest geo-tag)
content more direct to furniture (picture, tags, etc)
can add notification tab that enables users to know when another user liked their post.

-> Fixed some routing bugs with middle ware (specifically with creating/deleting posts)
-> Made sure that people who are not logged in cannot create posts
-> Made sure that users on cannot delete/edit/edit posts that were not made by them
-> Handled Token Expiry (properly logs out user once token has expired)
-> started working on pagination.

-> New bug with updating post (409 error)
-> New bug (dislike a post does not work)
-> need consistency across cards design

-> Fixed routing issue, a logged in user can not visit /auth page. Redirects user to posts page.
-> Refactor Home component to use Pagination.
-> Implemented search by Furniture and Search by Tag (404 bug)
-> Implemented pagination but there is a bug...
-> changed front-end a little bit

-> Pagination fully works
-> fixed bug with posts not rendering on front end
-> Implemented search by Furniture and Search by Tag (fixed bug with rendering searched)
-> Loading States (with redux)
-> Pagination is only displayed when search and tag queries are empty
-> Dynamic furniture post details page
